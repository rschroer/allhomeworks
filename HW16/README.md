### Assumptions and findings

The first assumption I have made was that the outcome of candidate or in other words, "not sure" was not useful data in the predition of the model. I also made the assumption that all of the features in the dataset were useful.

The largest finding I have is that this model is terrible. Even though it was scored what seemed hight to me ( score > 0.98), the precision for confirmed was lower than guessing randomly.
