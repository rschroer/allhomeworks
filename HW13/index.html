					<h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
					<p>My work explores the relationship between emerging class identity and emotional memories. With influences as diverse as Machiavelli and John Lennon, new synergies are crafted from both explicit and implicit layers.</p>

					<p>Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the universe. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corroded into a cacophony of lust, leaving only a sense of what could have been and the dawn of a new order.</p>
						
					<p>As momentary phenomena become clarified through diligent and personal practice, the viewer is left with a tribute to the limits of our era.</p>
